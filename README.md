## KeyLock Project Overview

**KeyLock** is a secure, ephemeral password and secret sharing service designed for teams who need to share sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or credentials temporarily and safely. It works as a self-destructing password manager by enabling users to share secrets via temporary links that expire either after the first use or after a predefined time.
